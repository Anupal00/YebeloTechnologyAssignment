In this Application I have used Spring MVC (model-view-controller) design pattern.
Controller --> Service --> DataAccessObject (DAO) -->Model

model the entity design into database which is created using ORM (hibernate)
then Repository helps to access or modify data using JpaRepository interface. Also we can write custom sql query.
then service layer holds all the business logic which are required in website.
and finally controller helps to route the url and also handle the request , response from user
